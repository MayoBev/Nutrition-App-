## General Information

We have created a simple resource for anyone looking to understand the macronutrient content of any food. It intends to help those looking to lead a low-carb lifestyle to identify diet-appropriate foods. We chose this project because 2 members of our team actually lead a low-carb lifestyle, and believe it to be very healthy.
